After delivering the v1.0 of Melon in February 2019, Melonport AG dissolved as promised, and handed over the governance of the protocol to a decentralized governance system. The Melon governance system can be described as being a skill-based and user-centric model. You can learn more about the Melon governance system [here](https://medium.com/melonprotocol/introduction-to-the-melon-governance-system-f6ff73c70eb0).

#### Mission

The long term mission of the Melon Council is to:

- Preserve the integrity of the network
- Maximize user adoption
- Foster innovation and increase network attractiveness

In practice, the Melon Council is responsible for the following:

- Protocol upgrades
- Resource allocation
- Networks parameters

#### Composition

The Melon Council (MC) is comprised of the MTC (Melon Technical Council) and of the MEB (Melon Exposed Businesses) representatives.

**<i>Melon Technical Council (MTC)</i>**

The MTC is the subset of the Melon Council that is responsible for providing technical expertise in various domains, and help the network make informed decisions.

The initial MTC members were appointed by the former Melonport team, and from there, new MTC members can be voted in by the Melon Council.

**<i>Melon Exposed Businesses (MEB) Representatives</i>**

The Melon governance model is also a user-centric model. It provides users with the ability to be represented, voice their needs and to take part in the decision-making process of the network.

Users of the network that can prove a certain % of AUM on the network have MEB rights, and can elect the MEB representatives who will sit on the Council and represent users.
